# php-lexoffice-api
PHP Laravel Package for LexOffice Apis.
The purpose of this package is to facilitate seamless interaction with LexOffice APIs within Laravel applications. This package will leverage popular tools such as Guzzle for HTTP requests and integrate Laravel's built-in HTTP client using the HTTP:: facade. Additionally, it will support features like media handling through the Spatie Medialibrary package. The package is being developed with a focus on providing a robust, reusable library, incorporating Laravel's PSR-4 autoloading standards, service providers, and testing capabilities using PHPUnit, Mockery, and Orchestra Testbench. My goal is to offer an easy-to-use, well-tested package that simplifies accessing LexOffice functionalities for Laravel developers.
